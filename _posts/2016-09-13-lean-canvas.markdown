[Shortcut: Lean Canvas Template on Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EPdOGYCj-EITxT5oo2d4XTwwa_CDLWcUMnN4Km1Detk){:target="_blank"}
<br/><small>Note: You have to create a copy of it to be able to edit.</small>

I recently finished reading [Ash Maurya’s book “Running Lean”](http://www.amazon.com/Running-Lean-Iterate-Plan-Works/dp/1449305172/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1454779205&sr=8-1&keywords=ash+maurya) and I think it is a great resource for anyone who is trying to build a startup (or any new business). One of the most important tools described in the book is the “lean canvas” that can be used to sketch a startup’s business model.

The approach to use a canvas to easily outline a business model has become quite popular since Alexander Osterwalder, a Swiss business theorist, published his work on the [business model canvas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) in 2010. Maurya derived his canvas from this original business model canvas to adjust it to the needs of startups. The lean canvas with the new boxes “Problem”, “Solution”, “Key Metrics” and “Unfair Advantage” are, to me, much easier to grasp and to work with. You can learn more about Maurya’s reasoning behind the changes in [this blogpost](https://leanstack.com/why-lean-canvas/).
One of the recommendations in “Running Lean” is to share the canvas with at least one other person. Therefore it makes sense to do it online right away, also because it’s common to change things quite often, even before actually finishing one iteration. When checking for simple solutions to fill out the lean canvas I was sure someone had already created a proper template to use in Google Spreadsheets but I couldn’t find one. There are other tools though, that can help you fill out the canvas, like Maurya’s own leanstack.com or the visual collaboration platform tuzzit.com. While I haven’t tried the latter, I found leanstack.com to be quite disappointing. It’s overly complicated, nonintuitive and lacks attention to detail. In the end I decided to create my own lean canvas template on Google Spreadsheets and to make it open for others. You can find the template [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EPdOGYCj-EITxT5oo2d4XTwwa_CDLWcUMnN4Km1Detk){:target="_blank"}.

Some notes:

Before you can edit you have to create a copy of it in your Drive (File > Create copy).
I added some hints that I took from the book as notes for each box. You can see them by hovering over the titles.
I decided to use sheets as a way to create iterations. To create a new iteration simply duplicate the previous one from the sheet menu.
