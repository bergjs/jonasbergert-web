One big idea of Steve Blank’s “The four steps to the epiphany” that is recurring throughout the book is to think and decide what type of market you want to enter. I found this very interesting and I urge every entrepreneur to take a couple of minutes and think which type of market you are about to enter and what that means for your business. Since the information about this topic is a little spread out over Steve Blank’s book, I decided to write a little summary about it.

### A. Existing Market
You’re likely to enter a new market when your product offers higher performance than what is currently offered from others. This could mean that you’re trying to build something that is faster, better or somehow substantially improved than similar products.

In an existing market the users and other market characteristics are known. Most importantly, your potential customers know that they have a problem and they know that products exist to solve it. The market need is hereby proven otherwise other players on the market would not have been able to survive. The customer development process will probably take only a few months.

On the other hand possible customers are probably more familiar with the existing competitors which means that as a newcomer it might be hard for you go get noticed. Moreover you have to compete with other companies with product features and performance meaning that you will probably be unable to ship an unfinished product since users in that market might expect more from you.

### B. New Market
Your users can do something they couldn’t do before. Your product is something brand-new and there is no established company that offers something similar.

There are most likely no competitors except maybe for other startups. Therefore performance and feature set are not important. The big issue is that the whole market, including the users are undefined and unknown. This means that the customer development process will most likely take longer than a year. The basic goal here is to convince a set of customers that they really need your product and that they should pay for it.

The big risk is here that you might be building something that nobody actually needs, which is the most common reason why startups fail. Trying to create a new market is connected to that because it is unclear if there is any or even enough demand for the kind of product you are building. This is why in this case it is extremely important to validate your business model with paying customers as soon as possible.

### C. Resegmented Market
#### Niche Segment
You’re trying to create a niche segment if you are building a product that serves a group of customers that would normally use a different, less specialized product. This might mean that your product performs worse in certain aspects that are irrelevant to your target group. By choosing a particular focus you are trying to win over customers of other companies. Be aware that existing companies in this market will try to defend their customers and might shift their feature set in your direction.

#### Low Cost Segment
You’re trying to sell a product that’s not top notch, but performs good enough for a substantially lower price. The good thing is, that existing companies tend to prefer the parts of the market with higher margins. It is up to you to find out if there are enough customers that are this price-sensitive so a sustainable market segment can be created.
